git branch -r (show remote branches) These are like a cache of the state of branches in the remote repository that are updated when you do git fetch

when you want to see the branches existing in the the local repository also, run git branch -a. Here, master is a branch in the local repository.

origin/master is different from master branch.The latter represents your local repository whereas the origin/master is like a pointer on what happens in github repository


git-ls-tree - List the contents of a tree object

git fetch origin ->The git fetch updates your so-called "remote-tracking branches".In this case origin represent the "clone" address

git diff master origin/master
you need to fetch the remote depository first using git fetch
origin/master and remotes/origin/master are essentially the same thing

Then you can merge the diferrences using git merge origin/master, assuming master is your current branch.
