git branch -r (show remote branches) These are like a cache of the state of branches in the remote repository that are updated when you do git fetch

when you want to see the branches existing in the the local repository also, run git branch -a. Here, master is a branch in the local repository.

origin/master is different from master branch.The latter represents your local repository whereas the origin/master is like a pointer on what happens in github repository

Then you can merge the diferrences using git merge origin/master, assuming master is your current branch.
